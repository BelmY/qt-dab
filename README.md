Introduction

![Qt-DAB with SDR file loaded](/screenshot_qt-dab.png?raw=true)

Qt-DAB is the result of merging the DAB-rpi and the sdr-j-DAB programs of the author. It became more and more complex to maintain different versions: modifications made in one version, did not always end up in the other versions so the versions started to diverge.

Since furthermore a separate "command line only" version is developed (a version not using Qt at all), while a large part of the sources is also used in the development of a version handling ETI files, there was a real need to reorganize.

It was therefore decided to merge the DAB-rpi and sdr-j-DAB version and rename the result - to distinguish from the Qt-free version -  Qt-DAB.

The Qt-free version, the "command line only" version, is named "dab-cmdline", is built around a library that does the DAB decoding, and has its own repository.

The software - both the Qt-DAB and the dab-cmdline version - supports decoding of terrestrial DAB and DAB+ reception with as input the  samplestream from either an AIRSPY, a SDRplay or a dabstick (rtl_sdr)s

The Qt-DAB version also supports input from an rtl-tcp server and prerecorded files (`*.sdr` and `*.raw`), which obviously provides the opportunity of dumping the input into a file. 

Since the Qt-DAB version has to run on a headless RPI 2, using the home WiFi, in- or excluding the part for showing the spectrum and the constellation, is determined by setting the configuration. 

Furthermore, as the Qt-DAB version has to run on a headless RPI 2, a configuration option is included to have the sound output delivered its samples through a TCP connection.

An (outdated) manual in PDF format can be found at http://www.sdr-j.tk/sdr-j-dab-manual-0.99.pdf (is valid for qt-dab as well)

Some settings are preserved between program invocations, they are store in a file `.qt-dab.ini`, maintained in the home directory. The background colors of the spectrum can be changed by setting them in this `.qt-dab.ini` file, e.g.
```
displaycolor=blue
gridcolor=red
```

------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two executable (exe files) to be found under https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab/releases . One is with a spectrum viewer and constellation diagram, the other without. Please copy them into the same directory you've unzipped http://www.sdr-j.tk/windows-bin.zip as it uses the same libraries.

If you want to compile it by yourself, please install Qt through their online installer, see https://www.qt.io/ 

------------------------------------------------------------------
Ubuntu Linux
------------------------------------------------------------------

For generating an executable under Ubuntu, you can put the following commands into a script. 

1. Fetch the required components
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake build-essential g++
   sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev qt4-default libfftw3-dev portaudio19-dev  
   sudo apt-get install libfaad-dev zlib1g-dev rtl-sdr libusb-1.0-0-dev mesa-common-dev 
   sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libsamplerate-dev libqwt-dev
   cd
   ```
   
2. Fetch the required libraries 

  a) Assuming you want to use a dabstick as device, fetch a version of the library for the dabstick
  ```
  wget http://sm5bsz.com/linuxdsp/hware/rtlsdr/rtl-sdr-linrad4.tbz
  tar xvfj rtl-sdr-linrad4.tbz 
  cd rtl-sdr-linrad4
  sudo autoconf
  sudo autoreconf -i
  ./configure --enable-driver-detach
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig
  cd
  ```
   	
   b) Assuming you want to use an Airspy as device, fetch a version of the library for the Airspy	
  ```
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config
  wget https://github.com/airspy/host/archive/master.zip
  unzip master.zip
  cd airspyone_host-master
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig
  ```   
	
  Clean CMake temporary files/dirs:
  ```
  cd host-master/build
  rm -rf *
  ```
	
3. Get a copy of the Qt-DAB sources
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab.git
  cd qt-dab
  ```
	
4. Edit the `qt-dab.pro` file for configuring the supported devices and other options. Comment the respective lines out if you don't own an Airspy (mini) or an SDRplay.

5. If DAB spectrum and the constellation diagram should be displayed, check the installation path to qwt. If you were downloading it fromÂ http://qwt.sourceforge.net/qwtinstall.html please mention the correct path in `qt-dab.pro` file (for other installation change it accordingly): 
  ```
  INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/include  /usr/local/qwt-6.1.3
  ```
	
6. Build and make
  ```
  qmake qt-dab.pro
  make
  ```

  You could also use QtCreator, load the `qt-dab.pro` file and build the executable.
  
  Remark: The excutable file can be found in the sub-directory linux-bin. A make install command is not implemented.


------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring using the qt-dab.pro file
------------------------------------------------------------------

Options in the configuration are:

  a) select or unselect devices

  b) select the output: soundcard or tcp connection

  c) select or unselect basic MSC data handling

Adding or removing from the configuration is in all cases by commenting or uncommenting a line in the configuration file.

Comment the lines out by prefixing the line with a `#` in the `qt-dab.pro` file (section "unix") for the device(s)
you want to exclude in the configuration. In the example below, rtl_tcp (i.e. the connection to the rtlsdr server) won't be used.
```
CONFIG          += dabstick
CONFIG          += sdrplay
#CONFIG          += rtl_tcp
CONFIG          += airspy
```
	
Input from prerecorded files (8 bit raw and "wav" files) is always part of the configuration.

Having the spectrum and the constellation shown, uncomment
```
CONFIG          += spectrum  
```

When "spectrum" is configured, a define

DEFINES		+= __QUALITY
````

can be set in which case a "quality indicator" of the signal, i.e. the
standard deviation of the phases of the demodulated signal, will show.
It holds: smaller is better

````

For selecting the output to be sent to a RCP port, uncomment
```
CONFIG         += tcp-streamer         # use for remote listening
```

The sourcetree contains a directory "sound-client", that contains sources to generate a simple "listener" for remote listening.

````
For showing some information on the selected program uncomment
```
DEFINES         += TECHNICAL_DATA
```

For basic MSC data handling, i.e. MOT handling etc, uncomment
```
DEFINES         += MSC_DATA__           # use at your own risk
````

and for experimental MOT handling within the data handling, uncomment
``
DEFINES		+= MOT_DATA
```
Two experimental configuration parameters are

CONFIG		+= try_epg
````

and

CONFIG		+= try_tii
````

When the first one is configured, epg data, when selected, will be written to
xml files. When the second one is configured an attempt will be made
to decode the Transmitter Identification Information. Note however, that
many ensembles do not carry this information.

	
------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuring using CMake
------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that there are now TWO CMakeLists.txt-xxx files in the directory,
if you want to use cmake, copy CMakeLists.txt-qt5 to CMakeLists.txt.

The CMakeLists.txt-qt4 file is used for creating an appImage and still
"under development".

The `CMakeLists.txt` file has all devices and the spectrum switched off as default. You can select a device (or more devices) without altering the `CMakeLists.txt` file, but by passing on definitions to the command line.

An example
```
cmake .. -DDABSTICK=ON -DRTLTCP=ON -DSPECTRUM=ON
```
	
will generate a makefile with both support for the dabstick and for the remote dabstick (using the rtl_tcp connection) and for
the spectrum in the configuration.

Devices that can be selected this way are, next to the dabstick and rtl_tcp, the sdrplay and the airspy.

The default location for installation depends on your system, mostly `/usr/local/bin` or something like that. Set your own location by adding
```
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=your installation prefix
```

For other options, see the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

Note that CMake expects Qt5 to be installed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SDRplay
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The current set of sources has some support for the RSP-II. It is assumed that at least library version 2.09 is installed.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Qt
------------------------------------------------------------------

The software uses the Qt library and - for the spectrum and the constellation diagram - the qwt library.

The `CMakeLists.txt` assumes Qt5, if you want to use Qt4, and you want to have the spectrum in the configuration, be aware of the binding of the qwt library (i.e. Qt4 and a qwt that uses Qt5 does not work well). As mentioned above, in the (January 2017) distribution of Raspbian Jessie, the qwt library provided is compiled against Qt4. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Raspberry PI
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Qt-DAB software runs pretty well on the author's RPI-2. The average load on the 4 cores is somewhat over 60 percent.

One remark: getting "sound" is not always easy. Be certain that you have installed the alsa-utils, and that you are - as non-root user - able to see devices with aplay -L

In arch, it was essential to add the username to the group "audio".

Note that on the current distribution of Raspbian Jessie (i.e. January 2017) the best way to generate the executable for Qt-DAB is to use Qt4. The qwt library - needed if you want the spectrum viewer and the constellation diagram -  in the distribution is compiled with Qt4. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
appImage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The releases section contains a generated appImage. This appImage is created
on Ubuntu 14.05 (Trusty), and uses qt4.

It assumes that you have installed a device, either a dabstick (i.e. rtlsdr),
an Airspy or a SDRplay.

All further dependencies are includes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment on some settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some values of settings are maintained between program invocations. This is done in a file .qt-dab.ini,
which is kept in the home directory of the user.

Some settings are not influenced by buttons or sliders of the GUI, they will only change by editing the ini file.`

Typical examples are

autoStart=0, when set to 1 the program will start the DAB handling atomatically`
   
saveSlides=1, when set to 0 the slides that are attached to audio programs will not be saved. If set to 1 
the slides will be saved in a directory /tmp/qt-pictures
   
picturesPath, when given a value, will overrule the directory where the slides are stored

showSlides=1, when set to 0 the slides will not be shown
