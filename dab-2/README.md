sdrplayDab is experimental software for Windows, Linux and Raspberry Pi for listening to terrestrial Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB and DAB+).
It is a variant of Qt-DAB, and optimized for use with SDRplay RSP
devices. It uses a completely different approach 
for recognizing DAB frames than used in qt-dab.
