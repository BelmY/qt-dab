Request:
	Create a timer module that at a specified time (or specified times)
	start to decode the service with a predefined name at a predefined
	channel, and write the output - either the AAC output or the PCM
	output, whichever is specified - onto a file. The name of the
	file should be the name of the service, augmented with the
	time (and date) of the recording.

	whatever reason the requested service will not start
c.	What is the range of the specification (12 hours?)
d.	do the specification survive closing the application for some
	time, i.e. assume that for some reason the app was stopped
	and restarted, is a specification done in a previous
	now still valid?

Specification or format
	time-in duration channel:servicename pcm/aac

	time-in is specified as "hour:minutes" to be set in a spinbox
	duration is specified as "minutes" to be set in a spinbox
	pcm/aac is specified as "pcm" or "aac" in a combobox

The resulting filename has the form
